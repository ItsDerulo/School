This repo contains various coding projects that I have worked on during my time at Southern New Hampshire University.
The first file This project is a text-based game that I created for my scripting class. The scene set here shows a journey to slay Dracula! The code here gives a guide on how to progress through the game through directions of North, South, East, and West. You travel through multiple locations on your way and your task is to collect the items from each location you visit. With these items you will use them to defeat Dracula and save your home.
